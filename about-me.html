            <h2>Travel Life!</h2>
			<p>I lived in Thailand, Cambodia and Laos for about a year teaching English as a second language, while there I met incredible people, ate great <a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/thai-street-food/"><i>food</i></a> , and visited some of the most beautiful <a href="http://blog.friendlyplanet.com/2014/08/the-6-best-beaches-in-thailand.html"><i>beaches</i></a>.</p>

			<h2>Returning Home!</h2>
			<link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Amatic+SC' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>	
			<p> I returned to OR with a great appreciation for travel, once home I finished my Marketing degree and started working for Reebok in their Global Retail department, I have had a plethora of jobs since then, but have always wanted to learn Code, so I signed up for <a href="http://www.codefellows.com"><i>Codefellows</i></a>.</p>
